## About

ComponentOne Studio Web API Edition is a set of HTTP services built on ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET Core technologies. Available as Visual Studio templates, Web API Edition enables you to create Web API services (RESTful services as well) in Visual Studio. You can add further customizations to your service applications, which can then be exposed to web over HTTP.

Web API Edition provides ASP.NET Core 3.0, designed to be deployed on multiple platforms and to support various hosting options. It runs as IIS (Internet Information Services) deployment, cloud deployment, and can also be self-hosted. Once deployed, the service application serves as server side for a wide range of clients (such as mobile devices and browsers).
