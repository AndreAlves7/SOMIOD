## About

DataEngine provides a suite of APIs that allow the user to analyze data from multiple data sources, including SQL Server, other SQL based RDMS servers, NoSQL service, web service, structured files from file/network systems, and more. The aggregating data can be consumed by other controls or application.



DataEngine Web API uses a column-oriented data model which is widely used in many open source and commercial analytical databases and libraries.  Data Engine can handle up to hundreds of millions records in a fraction of a second. The aggregated data is fetched from the Web API, the client application is simple, and it only sends the corresponding query to the server with some format to fetch the data.
